# Iris Classification Showcase

This mini-project demonstrates a simple machine learning workflow using the classic Iris dataset.
The goal is to provide an easy-to-follow example of training a model and evaluating its performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the example

Execute the classifier script:

```bash
python -m src.iris_classifier
```

The script loads the Iris dataset, trains a logistic regression model, and prints the accuracy and a classification report.
